## Game Center Project

Your project is to continue building Ruby games on the Command Line for Koding for Kids.  See the [Project Description](http://vikingcodeschool.com/week-2-ruby/building-the-game-back-ends) and the [Pivotal Tracker project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1158550) for more details.

As always, you will:

1. Fork this repository
2. Code up your solutions to the projects listed in the assignment description and the Pivotal Tracker stories
3. Submit your solutions as a pull request
4. Perform code review on your partner for the upcoming week

This is a paired assignment.  Feel free to ask your classmates or instructors for help.
